# Moirae Developer Test

## Overview

Welcome to the Moirae Developer Test! In this assessment, you'll have the opportunity to showcase your web development skills by creating a fully responsive home page based on the provided XD documents. This test is designed to evaluate your proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as your problem-solving abilities and capacity to adapt and troubleshoot on the spot.

For now we are looking for a responsive site with static content. Do not worry if you don't finish the page, just get as far as you can, we are focussing more on the skills demonstrated.

# Development Process
To keep the codebase safe from unknown changes, Developers must not have access to change the main codebase without review. So the
development is to be done in separate forks and not directly on the main repository. 

## First time development setup
1. [Create a fork](../../fork)
2. Clone the repo you forked.
3. Make your changes in the `develop` branch.
4. The breakpoints we commonly use are:
    - 320px (Mobile)
    - 768px (Tablet)
    - 1170px (Small Desktop)
    - 1470px (Large Desktop)
